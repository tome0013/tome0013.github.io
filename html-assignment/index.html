            <h1>About Me!</h1>

            <p>Hi! :) My name is Amy Tomei. I was born in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada on December 12<sup>th</sup> 2004. In 2012, I moved to San Jose California, where I lived for 10 years. In 2022 I moved back to Ottawa to finish my last year of high school. Now I am in my first semester of the Interactive Media Design program at Algonquin College!
            </p>
            <p>I <strong> love</strong> everything art related. My favorite mediums are digital art and collage. I hope I get to continue to express myself through my <abbr title="Interactive Media Design">IMD</abbr> program! I also love watching movies, especially with my lovely friends. Another thing I enjoy is collecting things. I collect a variety of things, including stationary (<em>lots</em> and <em><strong>LOTS</strong></em> of stickers), Sanrio, and anime collectables.
                </p>
